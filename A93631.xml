            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH SPOKEN BY The Biſhop of Carliſle IN The Houſe of LORDS; WITH Some OBSERVATIONS upon it.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Matter now propounded is of marvellous Weight and Conſequence, wherein are two Points chiefly to be conſidered; The Firſt, Whether King <hi>Richard</hi> be ſufficiently put out of His Throne? The Second, Whether the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> be lawfully taken in? For the Firſt, how can that be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently done, when there is no Power ſufficient to do it? The Parliament cannot, for of the Parliament the King is the Head, and can the Body put down the Head? You will ſay, but the Head may bow it ſelf down, and ſo may the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: It is true, but what force is in that which is done by force, and who knows not that King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Reſignation was no other? But ſhould we ſuppoſe he was ſufficiently out, yet how comes the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to be lawfully in? If you ſay by Conqueſt, you ſpeak Treaſon, for what Conqueſt without Arms; and can a Subject lawfully take Arms againſt his lawful Sovereign, and not be Treaſon? No, if you ſay by Election of the State, you ſpeak not Reaſon, for what Power has the State to elect while any is living that has right to ſucceed? but ſuch a Succeſſor is not the the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter, &amp;c. Silent leges inter Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> What diſputing of Titles againſt the preſent ſtream of Power? But however it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>reme injuſtice that King <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould be condemned without being heard, or once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to make his defence. And now, my Lords, I have ſpoken this at this time, that you may conſider of it before it is too late, for as yet it is in your power to undo that juſtly, which you have unjuſtly done.</p>
            <p>This Speech was uttered in the Lords Houſe in Parliament in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's time, who was the firſt of the Line of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> that uſurped this Crown of <hi>England:</hi> And it was hoped by all good Men, (that have any regard to a fair Reputation in this World, or that believe there will be a Day of reckoning in the World to come) that we ſhould never have ſeen ſuch lewd and villanous Actions repeated in our Age, as to make the fore going Speech ſo necſſary to be peruſed and examined again in theſe our Days; but ſince the contrary is too apparent, it will behove every Perſon of this Nation ſeriouſly to conſider of theſe two things; firſt, Whether the ſuſtance and matter contained in this Speech be true, honeſt and juſt, or no? and if it be reſolved in the Affirmative, then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether in honeſt Policy and Prudence we ought to follow this advice, for the ſecuring the publick quiet and peace of this Nation.</p>
            <p>As to the former point, a Word or two ſhall be only ſaid, not ſo much to inform as to put People in remembrance upon theſe following Heads, what the Word of God obligeth us to in this matter, what the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> teach; and laſtly, what the known Laws and Statutes of this Realm declare in this buſineſs upon every of theſe Heads, multitudes of Quotations might eaſily be produced, but one or two upon each ſhall ſuffice. As to the firſt, the Scripture ſays in expreſs terms, <hi>That Rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft;</hi> now conſider, in what words could God Almighty ſhew a higher Deteſtation of this damnable ſin of Rebellion, than by this Similitude; for as the Compact made BETWEEN
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151748:2"/>
THE DEVIL and the Witch, is a Combination to abdicate and deſert God, and to dethrone him of the Sovereign Power, that he by natural Right of Creation has over his Creatures; ſo Rebellion, ſays this unerring holy Spirit, is as this ſin of Witchcraft, which deſigns to dethrone God's Vicegerent, our lawful King, whom he has placed over us. If this be the Word of God, how can any Perſon be ſo impudent as to ſay that Rebellion is not a damning Sin? and ſince we know alſo that <hi>Lucifer</hi> was the firſt Rebel. As to the ſecond Head, moſt <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> do communicate in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or to qualifie them have communicated therein, and thereby are Members thereof: Now ſurely every good Chriſtian muſt believe that Church to be the beſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Word of God, that he voluntary communicates in, and is a Member of: If ſhe is the beſt Church in our belief, then we do alſo believe her Doctrines to be true and agreeable to God's Word, for if any of her Doctrines be falſe in our Opinion, then we cannot believe her to be the beſt Church, and ſo muſt renounce her Communion, and ſeek ſome other: Now our Church of <hi>England</hi> does abhor that damnable Doctrine of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> own Invention, <hi>viz.</hi> That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or upon pretence of Religion may fight againſt and depoſe their lawful Sovereign. Now I dare affirm not any ten of their other Tenets has made them ſo hateful to all good Men, as this pernicious one; now ſhall we abhor them ſo exceedingly for this depoſing Doctrine, and yet practice the ſame our ſelves, then certainly we muſt for the future either hate our ſelves, or elſe take thoſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them in our boſoms; for we are and muſt be accounted the Diſciples and Followers of thoſe Maſters, whoſe Rules and Precepts we put in practice. And if any body doubts whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares Rebellion againſt their lawful Prince to be a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sin, upon any account whatſoever, nay, tho they be evil Princes, let him read her Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Rebellion, which conſiſts of ſix parts, all which are full and expreſs in this matter.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what the Statutes of this Realm declare the antient and preſent Law to be, as what is Rebellion, which is ſo great a Sin by the expreſs Word of God.</p>
            <p>The famous Statute of the 25th <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Cap. 2. ſays expreſly thus. If any Man do levy War againſt our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King's Enemies in his Realm, giving them Aid and Comfort in the Realm or elſewhere, are guilty of High Treaſon: And ſure they that came to take the King's Crown, are his Enemies with a witneſs, as the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> did, againſt whom this Speech is directed: So now, 'tis very plain, that as Rebellion is a damnable Sin, ſo our Law ſhews what Rebellion is. Then let us examin whether by our Laws we may in any caſe Rebel, or take up Arms againſt our Prince; and for this peruſe the Statute of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Cap. 1. which obligeth all Perſons in Corporations to take this following Oath: <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do declare and believe that it is not lawful upon any pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt the King, and that I do abhor that traiterous poſition of taking Arms by his Authority againſt his Perſon, or againſt thoſe that are commiſſioned by him: So help me God.</hi> Now though the obligation to take this Oath is not univerſal upon every Subject, yet the ſubſtance and matter of it is undoubted Law, <hi>viz. That it is a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous poſition upon any pretence whatſoever to take up Arms againſt our Prince, or thoſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by him.</hi> If this be undoubtedly the Law, as it is, let us act according to the Law, who have been ſo angry with others becauſe they did contrary to Law; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Maxim has been allowed in all Ages to be true, that it is a preſumption in any Perſon or in any number of private Men, to think themſelves wiſer than the Law.</p>
            <p>And now let it be maturely conſidered whether it had not been well for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if the Advice given in this Speech had been followed; for who is ignorant, that knows any thing of our Hiſtory, of the many thouſand Lives that were loſt in the bloody diſpute for the Crown, between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood was ſpent in this unnatural War, than in twice Conquering the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> they that compute the leaſt, ſay it coſt above one Hundred Thouſand Lives. Ah! How diſmal a Scene does this repreſent to our view, that have any true and ſober Love for our native Country and Country-men; and how likely we are to come to the ſame paſs again, of one Brother killing the other, and the Son his Father, let every Man of ſenſe be judg. If we neglect the opportunity we now have, to re-ſettle us again upon the foundations of our known Laws; our Children, nay, our Childrens Children may be bound to curſe our head-ſtrong Humor, that made us ſo like the deaf Adder, as to ſtop our Ears to the voice of the Charmer; that is, the word of God, and the Laws of our Land. I ſhall only remark this one thing to all ſober <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, That there is not one Inſtance in all our Hiſtory of almoſt theſe Thouſand Years laſt paſt, that that Family which were known to have the Right of the Crown by lawful deſcent, were ever deprived of it totally. It is true, that Force and nominal Acts of Parliament made by Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> have depoſed particular Perſons that had the lawful Right to the Crown; but yet, always Right overcame Might at the laſt, and Peace was never firmly ſettled until the right Heir repoſſeſſed the Throne.</p>
